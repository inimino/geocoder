## Background & Objectives

In this exercise, we'll write our first AJAX request. Let's start simple with a `GET` request. We'll use the [Google Geocoding API](https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/geocoding/intro). We want to build a tool where we can input an address, hit a button, and get the **GPS Coordinates** back! Ice on the cake, we'll try to display a map as well.

## Specs

### Geocoding

Read carefully the [Google Geocoding API documentation](https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/geocoding/intro). It boils down to doing a HTTP `GET` request with an address as a query string parameter.

```
https://maps.googleapis.com/maps/api/geocode/json?address=16%20Villa%20Gaudelet%20Paris
```

Go ahead, add a form to your HTML page. It should contain an input where a user can type an address in, and a button to submit the form. <!--Then use the jQuery `submit` event to catch when the form is posted by the user. That's when you'll want to run the AJAX query to the Google Geocoding service with an `$.ajax()` call.--> Add an event listener for the click event on the button, and then use the Fetch API to make your query to the Google Geocoding service.

In the callback, try to `console.log()` what the API gave you back. It's a big JSON, look at it! Then figure out where the GPS coordinates are and display them on screen.

### [OPTIONAL] Displaying a map

To display a Google Map with a marker at the specified address, we'll use a second API, the [Google Maps JavaScript API](https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/javascript).

To use it, add to your HTML this line at the bottom of your file, just **before** the requiring of `app.js`:

```html
<script src="https://maps.googleapis.com/maps/api/js"></script>
```

To add a map, you'll need an empty supporting HTML element. For instance:

```html
<div id="map" style="height: 300px"></div>
```

Once again, please read at the [Google Maps JavaScript API documentation](https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/javascript).

To display a map in your `#map` element, you can use those lines:

```js
var map = new google.maps.Map(document.getElementById('map'), {
  center: { lat: 48.8648482, lng: 2.3798534 },
  zoom: 14  // Change this value from 0 to 18
});
```

To add a marker to the map, if the variable `map` holds the `google.maps.Map` object, you can run:

```js
var marker = new google.maps.Marker({
  map: map,
  position: { lat: 48.8648482, lng: 2.3798534 }
});
```

If you get the following warning, you can **ignore** it for this exercise.

Happy geocoding!
